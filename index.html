									<h6>Dear Ms. Cotugno,</h6>
									<div class="Hello"> <h3>Thank You</h3> </div>

									<p>I don’t know how I would have gotten through this year without you. Thank you so much for being an amazing teacher who has continually inspired me to pursue my passion, never letting me take no for an answer but rather pushing me to be the best I can be. Software Development hasn’t been easy; coming from an MYP mindset I was nowhere near prepared for this subject, but you’ve been able to take every challenge in your stride and let me come out of a different person with life long skills and experiences that I would never get anywhere else. This may sound cliché but I couldn’t mean it more: you’re the best teacher anyone could wish for and I’m so fortunate to have had you watch me grow over this year and hopefully for more years to come. Thank you for everything you do for us and the enthusiasm you bring to class every day, I’ll definitely be missing it come next year.</p>

									<p style="margin-bottom: 0">With ❤️,</p>
									<p>Garv</p>
